# Birb
A silly little repository for silly little things by a silly little man

## TODO (short-term):
- Implement more abilities
	- Add "King" crown ability (Use Fun as a template!)
- Fix collisions between enemies and player
	- Safest thing is to just avoid physics collisions between
	  player and enemy hitboxes
	- Enemies should be able to collide with each other though
	- Hurtboxes are different! Enemy hurtboxes should only hurt the player!

## TODO (long-term):
- Implement Save/Load
- Add more attacks
- Enemies
- Controller support
- Determine what the component grid should actually look like
	- 4 columns good enough for now?
	- Scroll bar? Adjusting column number?

## Other ideas
- 人 unlocks "helper" (subconscious?)
	- Can bring "mysteries" to unlock things
	- Converts jewels from one to another?
	- Shop?
		- Buy things using jewels dropped by enemies
		- Such as 図
- Crafting modifications
	- Recipe page + Recipe = Unlock?
	- Tools?
	- Jewel "password"?
		- Reusable or not?
