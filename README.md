# Birb
A silly little repository for silly little things by a silly little man

## TODO (short-term):
- Finish ÂçÅ ability
	- Why can't I see any of the things?
	- What's with the weird hitboxes?
- Figure out how to get passive abilities to actually work
	- What does this mean Max, please leave more detailed messages you nerd
- Add enemy spawners
	- We can use the enemy spawners for passive effects
	- Enemies that have already been spawned from a spawner should be kept
	  track of BY the spawner, so we don't need to find them when we apply
	  passive effects

## TODO (long-term):
- Implement Save/Load
- Add more attacks
- Enemies
- Controller support
- Determine what the component grid should actually look like
	- 4 columns good enough for now?
	- Scroll bar? Adjusting column number?
