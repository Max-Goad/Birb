TODO (short-term):
- Add passive slots and abilities?

TODO (long-term):
- Implement Save/Load
- Add more attacks
- Enemies
- Controller support
- Add passive (should have slots for those too)
- Determine what the component grid should actually look like
	- 4 columns good enough for now?
	- Scroll bar? Adjusting column number?
